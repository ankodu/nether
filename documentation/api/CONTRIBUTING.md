# Nether REST API - Contributing

## API Design Philosopy

The REST API for Nether is and should be designed to be easy to use and conform to the "normal" guidance of how a good REST API should look like. The Azure REST API (specifically the [Azure Resource Manager, ARM, REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn790568.aspx)) has and should influence the design and documentation of Nether's API. While still conforming to "best practices" of REST APIs, Nether's API has to take special consideration of beeing efficient "enough" for the different gaming scenarios it tries to solve.

## HTTP Response Codes

The API should conform to the "normal" guidance of returning HTTP Response Codes that conform to the [HTTP Standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### 200 OK

Default Response Code for GET Operations in Nether.

### 201 Created

Default Response Code for any API call that synchronously create a resource. If a corresponding request is made to retrieve the same resource, the caller should expect to retrieve the just created resource.

The response headers must include a Location header that gives the URL for the newly created resource.

### 202 Accepted

Default Response Code for aynchronous APIs. The response signals that the request has been received by the server, but perhaps not yet processed. A caller should not expect to see any imediate updated state in the service after calling an API that responds with this Response Code.
