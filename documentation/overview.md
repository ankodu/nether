# Overview

## Introduction - What is Nether?

In working with gaming partners, from indie developers to AAA studios, we have realized they are often trying to solve common problems. There are hardly any new games that don't require a backend for player management, leader boards and analytics purposes. **Nether** is a project composed of reusable set of building blocks, projects, services and best practices designed to support these commong gaming workloads on [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com).

## Features

- Player Management; administrate players
- Identity Management; authenticate & autorize users
- Leader Boards; a building block that implement basic leaderboard functionality
- Analytics; a mechanism to collect, analyze and react to incoming game events
- Unity client SDK

## Benefits

- Rapid Development; Nether services will hide the complexity of dealing with identity, player management, leader boards and game analytics. Once the service is deployed, simply interact with REST based API or leverage a Client SDK
- Reliability; Nether services are built on top of the enterprise quality infrastructure provided by Microsoft Azure
- Performance; a key technical requirement taken into consideration from the start of the project. Additionally, Microsoft Azure is available in many locations across the world, ensuring your services are always near your players
