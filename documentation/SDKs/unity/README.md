# Unity 3D SDK for Nether

## Work in progress

There is currently no Unity 3D SDK for Nether. We have it on the roadmap, but no planned dates set yet.  We welcome contributions from the community, so please help us if you have time.

If you want to integrate your game with Nether at this moment you can do so by manually calling the REST API.
